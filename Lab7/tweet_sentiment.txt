while other airlines were not cancelled flighting flights into bos and helping their customers get home virgin was saying good luck
dear virgin customer while you are stranded in sf for  days amp cost we will do the very least we can to accommodate you

grouping virgin in with the others now bos weather has exposed their actual cus serv model never flight booking problems with virgin again
as one of the travelers affected by the boston storm i am shocked at virgin s complete apathy toward their customers
umm so no reason as to why this is is there someone different i should contact or contact me to get a definitive answer
trying to make the change in advance not just  hours prior tried it online earlier and it wanted  in change fees

shame that there is no flex to tickets transfer rules even calling from neurosurgery icu is not enough

nd flight also delayed no pilots but they boarded is so we can just sit here scheduling
i guess that is too much ask huh
but it is hard to stay upset at someone when they at least try to show remorse
by the way a simple apology goes a long way even if it is a hollow one it is obvious that you do not care about me or my well being
this is not a one time thing either it is a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect
fingers crossed amp its all intact very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
it is an incredibly easy fix but you would rather stay in your comfort zone while i get forced out of mine
ours in july you have zero excuses for this you have an out of date system that causes problems like this
everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members they booked their tickets in october and december we bought
not sure what you are talking about she is going on nonstop flights sna to sfo and then sfo to ewr

i asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs localized problems and got back an unrelate flightd copy paste you can do better
what time who can i call i need my skis i will go to the airport and get them no more faith in united
i see you guys are at it again amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
a tourist wonder super tides and tide of the century at french and u k coasts
yeah sorry but there is always a problem with united and you have an international reputation for having problems
yall should probably work on that
but then again maybe the sd ks ia would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused
i wonder if sharing all this on fb and insta would produce a number  characters really limits my story telling
so you are telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff
could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived
yes please trying to get to pop in newark now
you have to follow me in order for me to dm come on now

every united flight between saipan and guam is an adventure you never know when s old plane will be operational

frankly worse customer service ever problems will happen how you deal defines a company never again united
it is still a valid flight just seems strange to delay for late flight inbound crew  hours from now when the plane is already here
thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the k desk
it is too bad ua has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight

i am very frustrated and have wasted  days now due to your equipment failures
computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app that is just ridiculous keep people updated

ua from madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by  ua employees maryjo was rude and unhelpful
system failure again bad trend software projects are like flying an airplane there is no such thing as an emergency takeoff
lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week currently sitting on the tarmac at ogg for over an hour
rebooting chicago dispatch system need as i am tired of sitting on planes
despite shaky connections looks like i ll get home tonight great job was touch and go for a while
however is completely under your controlthe price was and still is displayed on
the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to chicago

flight attendant doesnt understand not understanding english doesnt mean they are deaf stop yelling english slowly to them
not appropriate to ask in public hence the dm each united employee each a new answer your process was such a hassle i cancelled flighted
well that is big of you but i do not have terribly high expectations at this point
it is like you are trying to make me hate your airline fee for each checked bag that is never mentioned in the ticket rude agents

only thing confusing me is why i lost priority boarding i am a mileage plus card member 
we are hoping to hear from you actually
shes been rescheduled for today but with the frigid cold being a possible reason for maintenance it could be the same issue day
it is the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what is going on other than maintenance
b i contacted you directly and the phone service was laissez faire at best the problem is not a cancelled flightled a flight

i attempted to book a ticket  times and kept getting a error message i hope you did not still charge me

coach interior on ua  looked like it was salvaged from the s tiny unusable video no power amp lifevests on the floor ua 
now about two dozen back in line to see a single csr for reflight booking problems final leg kiosks on fritz

you have now lost my bag never ever flying united again joke

so you jacked out my cousins trip to portland and then cancelled flightled her return trip no more united
yes i did we headed out to de ice  minutes after i sent it to you made it to austin but am now waiting for the luggage
in ethiopia adopting a child need flight home from add to grr late flight   or very early   need to change existing reservation
after a cancelled flighted flight and  delays you lost my luggage again you are the worst disgraceful awful company horrible service
does not help the  or more passengers that just arrived an hour late flight
 minutes on tarmac now that is after  hour delay
i am very glad i took care of own rescheduling now that ua  from ogg was cancelled flightled
tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message how can i tell if it went through
is flight  going to sit on the tarmac forever
one of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes her tone amp language was very unprofessional
that is why i blame your company because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
i wanna be grand staff
sf crew lack a lot of customer service lax employees are a lot better wonder why
that is why i missed my flight if the flight had been held for  minutes i would have made it i watched it pull away from the gate
also did not ice the frozen metal walkway wasted  minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs
your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the tarmac did not have a gate agent once we got a gate
i wanna be ride united airline i love airplane
after  days  flight cancelled flightled another delay for  hours united gave me a  food voucher that is how much they value my time
checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass airlinesecurity
what the hell flight  delayed since  pm finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac is this f amp amp cking plane ever leaving
actually the flight was just cancelled flightled
i am a loyal premier platinum member but the lack of communication was really bad also i dont see that it has taken off yet
thanks for having changed me managed to arrive with only  hours of delay and exhausted
this is the nd time i was rebooked w delays and for reasons unrelate flightd to weather how do i go about requesting a flight voucher
if you consider  mins for bags  pm on a sunday night as fast as they can you should reconsider what you think that means
it is the horrible attitude from staff after not just the delay not the level of service or respect one expects from united
why do you want me to be loyal if do not let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
ua flight  sfo to lax took my carry on at gate i am group  overhead bins are empty
on top of that i paid for st class and my wife got stuck in coach
ph the pat answers are bs after i was denied boarding it sat at the gate until   your employees totally suck
over the last week united has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life disgusting united
 hrs since flight landed and zero info on my missing bag rough eta would be hugely helpful restore some confidence
big surprise nogate waiting for our plane same fucken issues everything i fly you fail worstairlineever
not to belabor my point but should not i be able to put a laptop bag above my seat why is it announced to leave it for rollers thx
maybemange the airline alittlebetter arrived at lax and no gate howisthatpossible always the same thing w u
i just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed i can no longer see the status of my equipment
even after running to gate from your connecting flight your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked stranded
i am desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this cancelled flightled delayed flight unacceptable ord
nope no more chances your airline messed up both ways of our trip
why announce it is for rollers at all if i want to put a coat in there is not that my choice how about all gate checked thx
you are my early frontrunner for best airline oscars
bags left behind because plane overweight be great if knew as soon as we landed instead letting us wait  minutes with no info
you are a f amp king joke your customer service is woeful if your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it
was a sponsor of the oscars no wonder it was a half hour delayed oscars
worked like a charm bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim welldone goodflight friendlysky
will lose my bag but will not give me free pretzels frauds
you are trying to charge me  bucks because you lowered your award tickets and i want to get my hard earn points back total bs
does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time gottogetbetter
apart from being on hold for over  hours and having talked to  people and the problem still not resolved
typical caned response from ua fix your crappy performing last placed ranked airline in this century
is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor
customer service is the worst hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold
was forced to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price  felt like a bait and switch tactic
love how you do not give a shit about people who tried to be loyal but you screw them every way till sunday glad i ve stayed away
tried a different flight iah mnl        flights are advertised for  but are not bookable due to partner error
it will be on a different airline
and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved
clicked upgrade now and it did not upgrade what gives
you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still cannot be book spent over  hours with united support
tried to book a flight iah mnl departing    returning    you are advertising  flights for  that cannot be book
i just booked a flight for  when i view my reservation it has mi connected to first name is this a problem can it be changed
quick serious question any resources ratings showing the quality of service is better than th place

flight  from ord could not let me know about this found out via app minutes before landing awful flight
i need help but in spanish

i tried the online tracking and they said something like attempting to locate luggage
your worker told us not to call because we had be talking to someone in thailand
going on  days tomorrow and i still have not received my bag from my flight to toronto would love to see some seriousness here
is there nothing you can do for me no compensation at all given the circumstances i feel like there must be something you can do
there is a disconnect between your pr group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground liars united
here we go again  of  segments sfo new york rt were delayed over  hrs each why do you suck so bad maybe another line of bus
you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from maui to san francisco poor communication bad help in getting connections
if you do not like delayed bags why do you let it happen so much
the delay is due to customer service for  people what about the dis service you provided for  flightfail hourdelay
he is so excellent and so reliable happycustomer
but again united doesnt give  shits about their customers
its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what i want is to read ya we will change that so our customers get better service

ridiculous i have to be refunded whenever i get at my final destination or not
stay more than h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
seriously ua  delayed because of the copilot is not here for   hours and he is only flying from raleigh disappointing

the costumer services here at denver intl airport is ridiculous bad
lied to my face at the gate about upgrades thanks badservice unitedsucks
i have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
ouch not fair
is synonymous to with rude and cheap you really do not know how to value the customer
i have to go back home i have to use what the company has available but it is unfair to stay more than  h traveling
if i miss the oscars i ll never fly united again
is the stingiest airline nobody should model after them ptfo cheap bastards stingy

it would make my day if i could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end train your employees to communicate
a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit what are you going to do about this
you cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not no empathy from gate staff or crew no apology really
rescheduled my return flight from japan uh why trying to call unitedairlines customerservice  min wait fun
is by far the worst airline ever 
no re booked with american and united said they would transfer our bags to them
i am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on   ewr to bos  hr delays need to be explained better
i am dming my info and no is assisting my flight home left before m first flight had even landed
boston is all self service swipe yr own boarding pass at gate most difficult tag your own bag not easy improvetheprocess
name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check in reminder first name and mi run together cause for concern
more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help
no consistency denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing faa your website policy says otherwise timeswitch
only  biz days  calendar to respond to my inquiry i hope your standards are universally adopted badcustomerservice
thanks but why did this occur you guys had  hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay so that is  hours you had fail

why not charge for nd carryon instead of checked bag less jockeying for overhead space happier passengers more ontime departures
adding reservation to ios app does not show up on desktop site when logged in and miles cannot be redeemed for upgrades thru your app

feeling like a true united customer stuck on the tarmac in dc for over  hrs unitedfail
pls follow for dm
leadership counts landed at   last night deplaned at    minutes of that was waiting for the jetway inexcusable
i sent you a dm as requested but have not heard anything can you address the issue i brought up in my dm and explain what happened
employee faceless do not throw them under the bus starts with management i am almost a million miler and own my own company  
you cannot say the flight is pulled in and departs in  mins if boarding has not even started
i understand that but why should i pay to change if it was a problem with your plane if it was weather i would understand
 hours late flightr still no answers stuck in houston keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared badcustomerservice
you guys are horrible first we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be min for a gate
the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher our flight was delayed then cancelled flightled then delayed again  hours and counting
dm d you  hrs ago at your request no response to be found just like my bag
worked out after all thanks for your immediate reply
two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport so far terrible customer service neveragain

as if a  hour maintenance delay was not enuf u charge me  bag as a global service platinum mbr get ur shit together
last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire another flight last week was cancelled flighted your track record is the worst
this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance
you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes each flight has a maintenance issue
can you put russell daiber on same ticket as well into premium eco appreciated
can you get me to okc from sacramento today dfw is now closed
any chance you could help rebook my flight cancelled flightled
out of curiosity when a flight is arranged are pilots notified there are a lot of pilots have not arrived yet announcements
yes to boston i was going to providence
you really need a better system for handling cancelled flightled flights
how are conditions in bos today i am in ua everything appears to be in time but i wanted to check
same day flights
it is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on late flightr
give me a direct number i can call regarding my lost baggage immediately
involuntarily bumped your passenger and cannot guarantee them another flight for three days
please follow faa guidelines regarding bumping it is not acceptable to give a  voucher for an  fare when you have
i did already rebook and now i will miss my first appointments in london tomorrow morning thanks for ruining my trip again
our newest delay right now
if you show available seats you need to honor that i shouldnt spend hr on phone to hear that really there are  not  seats
 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability badbadbad

thanks for writing back to assist you can return the bag you lost amp clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom too much to ask
you hung up on me again
your customer service team in manilla is absolute shit i cannot even get a supervisor without being out back on hold
it is disgusting and unconscionable the treatment i ve received tonight
of course i would like hepl are you kidding me that is the only reason i ve been on hold for the past  hours
every time my united flight got delayed this is a big frustration
you have got to be kidding me i still have not talked to a human and your robotweeting me and asking for a follow
i would not describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience to help you might find my baggage you lost amp return it
and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best

i am rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though i had st class seat orig i have a lousy coach seat
well this one missed the mark she was in a snit from the minute i stepped up to the counter

we have been seating for hrs inside flight ua at iad delayed we have only been offered water amp cookies in business class failed
please get me off this plane ua
yes on a nonstop to memphis tomorrow morning with the snow coming in i got my fingers crossed it will go

boarding a plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back makessense efficiency travel flying
it is   and the desk attendant stated we would sit awhile until given the all clear lack of communication seems to the norm

i d really like to get off of this plane now
possibly the worst airlinegave them three chances second time in  weeks a flight has been delayed and or cancelled flightled due to mechanics
cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious flight  landed in washington because of it my head is pounding

no customer service rep could confirm where my bag was amp each gave me different info ruined  events i had today disappointed
we have let you know how to help the millions of customers you have treated like garbage it is no coincidence ur ranked worst airline
yes after landing at pm last night spoke to  baggage claim customer service reps finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent
charging  for biz flight to uk somewhat egregious charging  on top for a sam adams draft at the united club is usurious

u guys did it again changed ages and double booked seats so i had to i ve even though i have platinum and the other person none

havent before and havent this time amp have checked spam junk mail just in casenothing
sloppy stuff you do not see anymore united has raised my expectations this team was poor
how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email
no bag tagging led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags
cabin crew were huge offenders stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers
allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane
no wheelchairs
no commitment to a good turnaround an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance
the nightmare continues
this team added  mins on turnaround
as a million miler with ua and flying almost every week i observe gate and flight crews committed to good operations
call wait times are over  minutes and airport wait times are longer
thanks we did
yes i ve been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me
thank you for compensating us for our  lost bags we will fly with you again unitedairlines
we are sitting on the runway for  hours it is ridiculous

have an employee at the gate min before boarding like u expect ur customers to be a competent company like ur rivals
no wonder the cabin is filthy badservice
and then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said not with my hands badservice
i need united to be a better airline
flight was cancelled flightled due to mechanical issues but when i ask for cab fare they say it was weather and cannot help me
i have not booked yet i am asking before i book
hi there looks like my connection is delayed too so i ll make it thanks
luckily i had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you you are welcome badservice
you really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard gross
cldnt be happier w the many plastic wing pins given to me on flight  i love them amazing staff so nice
since ua  ord ewr is delayed pushing it into meal time does that mean it will be catered with meals in first
help invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay maybe then you would not disappoint

once again your customer service rep was rude i asked a question and in turn got attitude jane was no help disgusted again
can you not see the thread
poor old united never seem to get the response right
obviously the staff at ewr united or otherwise have not seen your ads about being friendly and helpful ewr worst airport
also why cannot i pre select seats on sfo gt yyz flight i am a canadian flight booking problems on
does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare amp seats
thanks
hypocrisy rt i am sorry we are not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for kp
i should not have to spend my own on a hotel because of a weather delay the weather being something completely out of my control
eventually you should approach bags like they get it
what if my nyc flight is delayed and i miss my connection to sacramento from chicago
said they would give us a refund  days late flightr no refund
how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for   hrs not convinced your company is safe for flt
we showed up to our flight several hours early tried to call amp was on hold  min b f call disconnected
if your policy changed you must advise at the time of purchase same if you choose to vary it by airport we want a full refund
wanted to but you cancelled flightled my tickets they were too special i guess even for united
i am   for flight booking problems without major problems  is not bad 
ingeniero do not check your baggage if you do not have to they will lose it
i am hoping we do not miss our lax ito connection not looking forward to being stuck at lax overnight with our team again
well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated we travel between canada amp usa on united with only nexus
how can you not know after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded the planes weight
you make it hard to fly with you delayed over an hour and now the plane is turning around amp heading back to the gate connection
serious firing needs to happen at hnl they broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine
call customer service and of course they just say theres nothing we can do and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line
now submitted for the third time please check and confirm receipt have taken screen shots in case it disappears again thanks
if our already rescheduled flight is cancelled flightled is our hotel room paid for
classic
elizabeth at washington dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate i am super pleased
thanks
does the economy plus cabin also qualifies as a premium cabin
flight ua been sitting on tarmac for  mins with no report as to why any input
a rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off excellent service united is offering
no thanks
yesterday i am sorted now
thanks for that advice so helpful cannot believe you guys actually charge people to fly united
if you have had any issues with united airlines please retweet paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead
just tried to log in and was told e mail log in not currently available
so why did you cancelled flight tickets for thousands of people when you did not like the exchange rate doublestandards
do you have an e mail address i can write my account to might be less likely to disappear
so i wasted mins filling in  online forms you are telling me you did not receive how do i know this will not happen this time
 from amsterdam to ewr     
stuck here in iah waiting on flight  to honolulu for  hours due to maintenance issues could we have gotten a new plane fail
what kind of hypocrisy is that only cancelled flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage united
no the entire problem here is that i was never sent anything via email and only given a flight booking problems number over the phone
calling that number was useless heading to the airport now to pick up my bags this whole situation seems like a real joke
they could not get me first class on any of their flights so i just rebooked myself
but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster travelingwithsmallkids
i ll be sending posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter united airlines should be ashamed
hidden city forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg your support cannot fix
jt thanks for your help ill complete the form once we are back home
missed it incoming on time then sat for  then no jetbridge driver missed a min connection from an on time flight
ladies and gents united airlines
you might be dealing with frustrated passenegers hope you all have a great day thank you very much for an amazing airline
allright last question the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin does that include economy plus cabin
well it is la and then a hr car ride to a dark palm springs technically maybe i ll get bumped to st class den to phl on friday
yes still need assistance i do not have a flight home due to change in flight u made i miss all connections
i believe you have to follow me in order for me send you a dm
thanks we would like an apology and a full refund please confirm when we will receive
hi can you email me here so i can share the details thanks frank postsecret com
but i got a bad exchange rate so want my money back please can you refund without penalty
my flight ua to denver for rmoug has been re cheduled  times if i am no show you will know why ridiculous
you are just using automated responses and do not have the decency to actually care respond
jt the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
here i was thinking how i could say so many nice things after getting upgraded but then you delayed my flight it is ok
can you explain how it rewards us elite premiere k members
for our birthdays my fianc amp i want to travel late flight april you are our fave airline but frontier has this
im resending the confirmation code in a dm
i did dm the details back on   when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
airlines ceo jeff smisek disloyal to loyal workers via
the guidelines say xx my bag is x x  so it is a bit taller than the guidelines is that gonna be a problem
thank you i wish the lady in little rock had told me that in the morning when i asked her
no claim number have not been back to iad baggage since is there a phone i can call to speak to someone
do you think there will problems at newark nj on saturday due to expected snow

thank you for the speedy response i figured it may be something of that nature you guys and your fine print haha
worst service ever 
thanks for your attention i would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at dca what is my best option
cannot believe united cannot find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport loved united but debating choice
i am furious you are firm is a disgrace despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter all alone at night united
holy high speed internet batman speeds at united club at iad are insanely fast thanks
your website flight booking problems experience is an obnoxious upsell laden disaster for anyone with half a brain
like  weeks after my flight creative
flt  is having some major delays bc ground crew was so slow the flight crew has been terrific been  hours on the ground 
sorry i hate united i will not get to see my family until thursday
thanks for the timely service amp great staff getting my wife and me to and from cancun this past week for our honeymoon
done just now thanks
currently on standby to lax then it is a  hour ride to palm springs long day starting at a snowy   am in philly
your customer service for mileage plus customers is a disgrace i just spent  min on the phone to reset a pin number with no luck
no i do not i was only given a flight booking problems reference number
all these changes way to stick it to your premiere k loyal customers why make things harder for those that loyal to you
thanks for the offer but i finally made it to my destination albeit hours late flight
airlines cancelled flights oc fll flight today  to switch no notice no apology we are done flying unitedairlines
can you send me another confirmation email
it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders
i travel a lot and i get it you are still my fave but ewr to cleveland w  min layover to connect to dc our best option come on
pm and my bags still not here not even a courtesy toiletries kit not the flight experience i was expecting very disappointed
airlines cancelled flights oc fll flight today  to switch no notice no apology done flying unitedairlines

hi jh my experience with united has been entirely disgusting but yes i d like assistance in getting compensated for my bag
took this picture on thursday awesome
probably would not be doing it had someone returned my call or email case number 
i cannot even fit my name on the first two lines yes please do pass on feedback this is a big downgrade from previous years
is expiring the offer to buy or transfer united mileageplus miles with discount many offers during a year
no it was  flight cancelled flightlations one due to weather one mechanical paid own hotel bag held in transfer no voucher compensation
i got email that my reservations got cancelled flightled and i will be refunded nothing got refunded as of yet

flt  has had two more updates in the last  minutes

quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through not really the service i was expecting
stuck in iad going on  hours waiting for a ferry flight from nashville that u cannot tell when it will arrive ridiculous
flt  no gate agent no announcements so unprofessional time to go back to
thanks kp please also mention the quiche breakfast and tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly first class
flt  departure time has changed five times in the last  minutes why do not you figure out a solution and announce once
bags are still in houston since friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee
who can tell me where they are
flight  have already been cancelled flightled once been trying to get home two days staff being very unhelpful
each flight is worse than last flight attendants do not even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats
flight  agent now wandered off pilots came out looking for her went to charge her personal phone which she would been txting on
waiting for flight  to memphis incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay  of  rude
i do not see how i need to spend an extra  bc of ur equipment failure
i do not need to make any changes i reserved my seats when i bought my tickets and there was an error amp now there are no comp seats
its  and no power outlets at the seats on a  hour flight to california seriously this is why airlines are failing pathetic
thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so i did not miss my transfer
no not received any e mails in either inbox or junk spam
could you please send me a phone to the refunds department we have submitted our claim through email without success
i am not this person but i ve been sitting in denver for three hours and all i want to do is get on a plane please let me go home

what is the policy behind changing passengers seating assignments at the gate

she has crossed  prior times with other carriers and no issue karen was rude untrained and unhelpful i also spoke
nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air car or boat she can travel with only nexus
 employee yelled at her  employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
 refused boarding with nexus nexus confirmed she should not be refused
on a good note the  employees i encountered newark were fabulous i was very late flight for my connecting flight and they got me on
u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee does that make sense to you and yes i already called cust svc they said no

we rebooked but and i had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours frustrating
no worries about the tweets we all should do what we can to make sure we as in your tag line fly the friendly skies
i am thankful to the united ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out home late flight is still home
i appreciate the follow up
that is the gist of what the flight attendant told her
btw is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation
what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger s shoulders
no but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business
sat at airport for  hrs still sitting at gate sigh
actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake she did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation
gold star for united change my flight miss all connections but cannot accommodate me until a much late flightr arrival time not happy

 jetblue our fleet s on fleek  this happened
definitely no note from whoever stole from me
but the  hour policy when i called and they said i did not report it soon enough what would have changed if i had noticed sooner
hopefully that will help someone in the future would there have been a different procedure if i had discovered the theft sooner
i did that as soon as i realized will they try to figure out who is stealing from people s bags security cameras anything
i did but since i was stranded in syr without a ride i missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter  hours
absolutely no worries i am just never flying with you again ever even i have to hitch hike cross country passengersarepeople
dont lose my luggage
you just directed me to your mobile website where is the direct link get it together

nope the regular line was multi x faster you literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as ems
sounds fun how does that work
thanks calling right now
thank you but that is not really responding to my request is it you are sending me into a generic environment on your site
i know there is no actual mile high club but surely there is something i can join

thank you for the free flyfi makes an already great airline even better jetblue boston westpalmbeach flybetter
what is the easiest way to get a ticket receipt can i get one at check in or can i get one online thanks
thank you
any effort to fix your points system  days and a call to customer service and still no account update chasing points is no fun
i tried had me running from curb side to self check amp wasting even more time ended up flight booking problems united for am so upset
keeps getting better no water on the plane
that is what i planned on but boston traffic due to recent weather was insane if i had been expedited i would have made it
i wish you all the best of luck i am enjoying the luxurious free amount of leg space rn thanks
i do not want jetblue tv i want jetblue wifi
great to see the redsox plane and your reminder you ny side by side at jfk catsanddogslivingtogether
would love to go to hawaii to visit pearl harbor
what is the deal with flt  today departure keeps changing when is it going why is it so late flight
lol at your estimated departure time plane has not even started boarding yet you cannot even get your delays right
you know how i love you jb but honestly when you have complex feedback those pull down sub option forms maddening
said they have not started looking for it gave me a   limit in nyc at the waldorf astoria and cannot find  outfit 
how can i best track deals and special flight offers i am liking your international options
yeah i am aware of that hence my original msg to you
 just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal airline is a disaster
no i asked either way it does not make the flight less delayed
 from orlando to dca and my awesome flight attendant is robert
yes i filed yesterday around noon i have a claim number but they have not contacted me yet
shocker my flight delayed an hour thanks for reminding me why i switched to delta
as courtesy to mosaic members or anyone a request for water should be attended promptly daniel in flight  should know better
are you having any issues with online check in my colleague and i are getting webpage not available after submitting online form
no one yet but some fl 
are going to let fl into a gate in bos any time soon we are just sittin here on the tarmac waiting
thanks jb actually as a birder i love them too they just need to be outside it should not be too hard to trap and move them
not an issue but i think training amp information would help great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better
rats that is a bummer
is so sloooooow today
happy for sfo but hopefully you will add pdx soon  jetblue we added two new destinations fll and sfo from las vegas in the last year 
flight from jfk sfo was pure awesomeness mint class and tim our attendant was the best other airlines take notes
terrible landing on 
flight was two days ago flight  from pos
wall separating in row  safetyconcerns
last sleep in cali back to jfk tomorrow night looking forward to an another amazing flight with you all
woo update flight  is now possibly delayed by more than hrs power of positive thinking people
appreciate the response but already spoke to a mco and their response was there is nothing we can do idk if that is what you mean
with the free wifi impressive flyfi
did not find out my flight for ny scheduled to leave at  pm is delayed by more than  hrs until after checking in huge fail
vegas desk said jfk connect would b held  us and  others on our plane now staff at jfk says weather was problem epicfail
other jfk to boston flights went off with some delay but not this epicfail
i understand delays we are all looking at a tv monitor at ur gate and it says current conditions are snow hence delay
mint seats are awesome best business class in the us
wtf stuck at jfk for  hrs in a delay to boston cuz u say snow no snow on weather map wtf
thank you for getting me home and despite all odds i have reunited with my delinquent southwest luggage now homeward
 words staff training what a joke
is a joke missed my connecting flight by  minutes last flight of the day and they do not hold it  minutes
sorry should have specified i meant ground traffic trying to get into the terminal
any idea what is going on at terminal five at jfk seems to be zero traffic movement
very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept i nearly had to beg get just for a courtesy report
ok thanks safety first
apparently the plane was delayed coming up from san juan monsoon there today
that is ok it just sure seemed like it when jetblue tweeted us back and asked us to send selfies of us watching haha
over  hour delay going from nyc to denver come on man
no oscars on direct tv on this flight we were so looking forward to it we were devastated
fix your amp jet bridges  minute delay nd gate still waiting jetblues
kudos well deserved just wish the rest of my experience today measured up to their example
ha ha can i get a wake up call at boarding time please large coffee extralight extra sweet please
did not work fly fi plus could not access abc app so i spent  and still missed oscars disappointed
 i think i ll come take a nap at the terminal
safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not
pretty sure he is saying ricoh had great service down at bos happytohelp
 from jfk to las still delayed
the lack of tv made it rough that is literally why i picked you all over the competitors
but not reddit i work for the site and this is ridiculous
thank you i am your new big fan
i do the best airline wifi ever thank you
you just tight that you are  on the world s best airlines list amp is ranked higher here i come
i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimi why dont you guys go to maimi
such a bummer but i understand it is a business deal thanks for answering me much less sad now
aka take stuff out of the checked bag then just carry on the extra weight for someone just had shoulder surgery that is just no
pilot do not worry folks there is a backup for the backup for every part of this plane thanks guy
can you take off your blacklist trying to work
goodwill now at     x fine still want your new ceo to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 
thank you hopefully it is soon we are supposed to leave at  
thank you
awesome
okay so anything using contactless emv should work just your internal testing and training is currently apple pay specific
hard when you are with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane we should get better than this
had a potentially stressful situation in reflight booking problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome
even tho the extra  lbs are still going on the plane just as a carry on where is the sense what do you say to fat people
i thought being a mosaic member had perks the best part is instead of checking the extra lbs i am carrying it on 
are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days you went from  to  for overweight fees outrageous
if only the show was on the flight no abc oh well i ll live nexttime andthewinneris
ill call in the morning too upset right now
im still waiting no answer
ok thanks for your help
love you guys
the amount of money i spent on hotels for a week bc of flight cancelled flightlation another flight does not make up for the money lost
being told jfk had a  hour delay this am which is reason for my delay now it cannot be that hard to notify with  hours notice
by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk
keep waiting time does not cost anything for hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback
you are still the best
please give jetblue all the permissions in the world i am missing the oscars right now and it is awful whyabcwhy
thanks so the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather relate flightd problems
i ll be checking often most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds geeks and badly dressed
i am less concerned about the delay than i am about not being notified until i looked at the board that my flight was delayed
thanks i made it 
after boarding flight  the captain informs that he could exceed the hrs regulation and turned the plane around incredible
thanks for the quick response fingers crossed the plane gets here then
considering accessibility is an absolute must equality
how do we watch the oscars though right now no abc on flight missingtheoscars
thank you fingers crossed
ooookay that is silly of you guess we are watching the oscars purely on twitter reactions tonight oscars
i ve heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept only apple pay i thought that was impossible amp certainly not emv compliant
you are taking me to new orleans in two weeks so i ll picture that while i shiver forevercold
we are flight  ffl to lga scheduled departure  p
nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster last time i was not allowed to fly stndby now a  hour delay w out notification
oh right me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in sdq
a bunch of flights are delayed from ffl to northeast destinations no announcements at the gate what is going on
i am dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight  in santo domingo have been treated hrs to board the plane and no info given
id appreciate that would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that i be allowed to announce over intercom
if you want we can keep you updated on who is wearing who amp who is with who amp who wins what we are nice like that
i did they have no idea where it is
thanks but still annoying especially if i miss my flight  can i tweet at the tsa
hey jetblue still waiting to hear where you lost my   surfboard between jfk and bqn airports
your gif game is strong
well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility
flight  den to jfk already hrs delayed any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc
why close prechk at pm on a sunday at jfk annoying
your crew did not say it was about safety if they say that i was glad to stay check the information you give to the costumers
you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in south florida bc of your disorganization getittogether
i am going to write a post on about the experience your customer service has tanked jetblue
still no response from ceo i guess he is at the oscars i bet his flight was on time justwrong
okay names of sj crew are alamo tatiana keep telling me to hold then leave desk ali told me he could not help bc going on break
aha ok thanks was worried there might not be a seat at all will do it at the airport tomorrow then
that is a stock response delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv amp being told by  ppl to wait amp they would come back but did not
ricoh smith at bos provided oust and service
 hr delay on flight to jfk via tampa amp worst customer service in san juan airport this after app not working all day
just please get my luggage from  onto carousel  logan airport and i ll be able to go home
what happens when i have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for even more space upgrades
thanks for the response just been waiting for  hours and really frustrated seems like no one at jetblue is concerned
tx for the info just do not understand why you could not accurately estimate departure time earlier weather in ny is fine now
hey me and my family have questions on a trip to disney world that we are doing in april please follow me so i could dm you guys
 jetblue so glad to hear thanks for sharing the video  me and jetblue are bff 
no m good just get me home
thanks for the response we are hopeful
update please on why flight  continues to be further delayed
ok tx will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate
thank you for not even coming with a solution great service i might say as a trueblue member i am totally dissatisfied thanks
all day
how about free wifi on flt  out of pbi to make up for   hr delay treat us right
why is flight  delayed out to ny same problem
is that a guarantee we will see about that tomorrow morning when i have to fight for a seat
thanks for the update preciate it hope it gets here been delayed  days getting back
yes they are working on it hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home
well my paid tickets have no assigned seats at all so essentially i will not be on this flight unless i pay more
if seats are not guaranteed why do we pay for them when i called the rep said some other people booked our seats
thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter excellent customer service and focus
yes please get me the seats we paid for
flight  departs   am finally arrived jfk with no psgrs at   pm that is a long flight aka bus
thanks for help cannot wait to travel with and get out of the snow
help i left my nikon camera under the seat in front of me what do i do
i hope your customer service reps are as reliable friendly as they usually are so far you are not living up to your rep exper
the man with the smell left nd now there is this stupid girl asking me questions can yall help
fyi the last email response we undrstnd this wasnt best  you but hope  wlcm u back onbrd n the future nice touch lol
i think i have it selected already 
last flight was cancelled flightled then it was  hours to change a light bulb now sitting here waiting for maintenance unreal
thanks for answering my questions
that was not delayed or cabcelled
i have to say that jetblue has officially lost a customer what a waste of all the points i have too i am yet to be in a flight
i will keep on tweeting until your ceo answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight  just wrong
i think it is safe to say that after  years of loyal jetblue flying we are officially done byebyejetblue
i have someone driving me it is best to get a wheelchair once i get inside
finally finally
token   goodwill voucher for passengers stuck on flight  from phoenix today  hour mark how about a   per passenger
anything serious i should worry about
cool are there stairs at jfk i can walk short distances but not stairs
think about it boarding to a chill untz untz untz like this
why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you jetbluefail
seriously what is your solution who exactly will help my  year old if there is a problem with the plane
your scheduling skills failed the delay went from four hours to nearly six do not tell me you were snowbound in pbi
the man sitting next  me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight
sadly no i have the app but it also is experiencing difficulties the flight information boards are keeping me updated
this is absurd should a stranger help my kids if there is a problem jetblue
i have a disabled seat in row  do i get to board earlier
thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel when bag missed connection sfo customerservicenot
flight 
pittsburgh
you are lucky we are still flying you after today s landing gear failure get your act together and help us sit with our kids
so the prefference option is not something that you honor so why having it as one of the services if not applied
if you want to be helpful find us a seat do not quote terms and conditions jetbluefail
do you really think it is okay to sit kids away from parents srsly esp after your landing gear failure
they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids your terms response is insulting jetblue
flight  jfk to tpa  am on saturday one way ticket
what is your excuse this time for  delay from lga to tpa i know the plane is in the air
if you cannot guarantee parents will sit with their children do not sell tickets with that promise jetblue
once you go blue you do not go back
why are there so many delays to north east cities
kids fly do not hire people who do not care about them this guy jetblue
i should not be made to feel like a criminal because i want to sit near my  year old on a flight jetblue
usually i have such a great experience with you guys very very unhappy with you right now
why would you hire a guy who does not care about the safety of children not remotely acceptable
what is up three delays so far resulting in over three hours of unnecessary extra waiting
for the record that was less than a  minute turnaround time for the answer from the question jetblue rocks
never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids but this guy is willing to do it jetblue
from san diego with a  hour delay to jfk even you have a amex jetblue even having over   travel miles you are still nothing
it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a  year old alone is considered okay but this guy thinks so
third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys this will be my last trip with you
you have let me down   delay at jfk because of inbound flight from syracuse really ishouldhavedriven
a  year old cannot sit alone on a flight this is absurd and this guy is a dick jetblue
being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our  and  year old on the flight jetblue
of my tray table is broken what do i do
domestic to be clear i do not have to sit in your lovely terminal just need to be there  hour prior to boarding thanks
thanks for not sending me an update that our flight was delayed  hours unbelievable
the fact that chrishasmadeusblush is not trending is how you know i am loyal
 hours delayed now in hour increments really amp as mosaic i still have to pay  to use lounge during this waste of a sunday
no i have not done that yet is that something i can do online thx
woof i am on the red carpet
no wifi on this flight so we cannot tweet you our oscar party pics at  ft bluecarpet seabos
thank you for the reply would have appreciated communication before checking in about the delay jetblue used to be my go to
what confirmation number
you also promised to change my wife s name on the account and it is also not done wtf
you guys really suck i just spent  minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account they are still not there  
btw robin hayes is speaking at next month s aviation summit he ought to give a shout out to his twitter team you rock
follow for dm please
oh and thank you for responding
where is it coming from i thought tampa
good perspective if only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before i arrived at the airport communicationiskey
exactly why is my flight delayed  bdl to dca cannot seem to get an answer
thanks we are ticketed on stand by for flight  i hope we make it out fingers crossed
flight from bos rsw tomorrow all i need is my wife yr old to sit together but no option when checking in
is your partnership with hawaiian live earn hawaiian miles flying jetblue if so how do i add to my jb flight booking problems
you left  people on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to jfk because of
at what point in delays can i take a different flight to my destination
thank you guys you are the best 
you just do not get it it is not about the money it is about people how about a public apology from the president of jet blue
why when you book a flight now does jetblue separate a yr old from the mother is not that a bit stupid check in headaches
does not fit in 
love it as always
you never got my wife to her destination and you expect a   goodwill credit will make everything hunky dory you blew it
every time i look at the flight status  more minutes is added to the delay how about some points for trouble
as soon as i can sending my son home with you saturday
hey awesome peeps what is up with flight  from boston delayed hrs
is there wifi on he plain
what a great experience on flight from sfo to jfk seats service food everything is top quality i will be back very soon
flights  and  i have picked up twice this week for  and both times it was delayed 
what is up with delays to and from boston today my sister is trying to go home and bro in law trying to come to rdu craziness
wondering if it is possible for my colleague and i to get on an earlier flight lax gt jfk tomorrow can you help
 to boston still sitting
now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be mins into hrs
hope so looks nice and warm in san juan 
thanks for replying i feel a little better we will see how it goes 
i usually do but i did not make the flight booking problems this time that ll teach me yea i have that going for me at least haha
i waited  hrs for my bags and my flight was only  hrs
should i bother contacting them i already checked into my flight 
early last month via expedia there is an extra middle name and initial attached to my last name
backlog is an hour at most this is over two unacceptable
your agent told us tsa did not have a crew to get bags
you guys rock
my email is my twitter handle followed by gmail 
awesome bestairlineever
no baggage crew update your staff is incompetent with no answers after  hours
the whole plane flight  from lga to pbi
is blaming for flight  luggage debacle luggagegate
yoga it is tv service seems to be down though i look forward to that do much
w edits dear your mbas need better benefits they should work for us how can we meet them
of course i am 
you failed that is the answer please do not justify otherwise
come on already delayed  hrs on flight  as we waited for the pilot to come from boston now you reassign him endless trip
when i got your alert i immediately started looking to rebook but we only had  minutes from reflight booking problems to catch a flight to srq
i only fly jet blue
perhaps you need to start recruiting
start including pto in your getaway packages and i am all in
thanks i will use the extra time to do some more shopping did somebody say duty free
s flight flight booking problems experience is pretty great
still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row
thanks for making my trip home mintyfresh next brandmance flight i ll take more selfies love travel business
i should not have to find them they should tell us i ve flown jet blue since your first month the experience is not what it was
if my flight was delayed can i show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do i have to go on time
i am over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey
if that was the case why did your alert arrive so late flight four hour delay do not buy it
our flight out no tv now our flight back not seated together b  maybe our fault still no fun
i do not believe so that is not what the team has told us
also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a  hour international flight
 out of jfk no one has info amp no answers as to why we boarded the plane the team is in an awkward spot amp everyone is cranky
i have a reservation for tomorrow morning but trying to get back  night bc other flight was going to jfk can i get on list at ctg
flight  is still waiting for bags most of us checked in  hours ago people are missing connections please help
any way to get  ppl on standby list for flight  fll to bos trying to find way home
something to think about when you are dealing with people just wrong no excuses figure it out amp expect the unexpected
i understand but wish you would have announced the delay  hours earlier vs sitting for  hrs at mco
what gives delayed over  hours at mco to jfk every time
 jetblue well captured brittany we love the clouds enjoy the ride  thank you
my wife was with our dog they would not even let her out off the plane my daughter was at newburgh lives close by so wrong
according to your ground staff it has not even been taken off the plane yet
thanks for making an effort credit where credit is due flight  delayed  hours instead of  hours fwiw loweredexpectations
at what time all these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over  hours just wrong
flight delayed at jfk  hours then  hours then   hours now it is back to  hours with no explanation or apology
thanks have a good sunday
flight  had a    hour weather delay but what is the  minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers
hrs on tarmac yest b cancelled flight today  hr delay why not send txt email re jfk closed amp saved all trip  sit again

thanks for the info already doing it now before we board looking forward to the future upgrades jetblue

any idea when the flight will actually take off
i love jetblue flyfi when will we be able to charge our devices on domestic a flights thanks
still sitting in plane in newburg this is getting ridiculous no way to treat loyal customers
touchdown jfk well done pilots of jetblue flight  jetbluerocks
what is the delay if the system is not down
not blaming jet blue this was not weather cannot have planes in the air and runways a mess that is a disaster waiting to happen
do not think any rly knows what is goin on supposed  leave at  a then a then  a then a then a then  a now 
that is not very gracious of to tell me where i can go buy water or a snack when our flight is delayed over  hours
and ask she load the bag for my flight
after applying my new tag she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt i had to walk back  yards
get flight  into the air

thanks for the personalized customer service cannedtweet autoresponse
then this agent demanded i remove my old luggage tag every other airport the jb agent politely handles it

no it did not all work out i called jet blue from mexico to address the fraud alert with capital one on the line rebooked

i called jet blue to get an explanation and make sure it would not happen in the future i was told to write the fraud dept
we made it safe and sound thank you for the safe travels
when i arrived at the airport i was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert
my card company and i explained the issue over the phone when i was in mexico i purchased a new ticket over the phone

hi i am in lga but my luggage is in clt have been told to come back tomorrow to collect do you guys want to cover my taxi fare
instead of fair treatment i got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death
a few years ago i lost over   miles bc i was physically unable to fly during the period i submitted a doctor s note
i ve never been treated this badly
i am glad this airline is going to be swallowed by american american always picks up the phone and solves problems
three months and my miles have not been credited no one is going to read the email i sent
my email gets me a canned response that it takes  days for mileage to get credited it is been three months and my miles
my tweet gets me a response to email dmsc usairways com
the help complaint forms on the website can be used only if the matter applies to an actual ticketed flight
no one picks up the phone all day no opportunity to leave a voicemail
instead the miles are credited to an account that i did not open my request to merge the accounts is denied
no i was there  hrs early send me an email to share my experience you do not want this blasting here
i open the credit card and earn   miles and you wont credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles
you took the miles out of my account and told me that i could restore by paying  or opening a credit card
i had   miles in my account and was informed i d forfeit them bc of  months of inactivity i
it is all automated and no one cares to understand the problem i am having
screwed me up big st flight hr late flight made it to nd flight csm daryl would not let me on the plane because we were  
houston hub aa t employee the bag is not here it made it to pa before me oops not your problem

yay for glitchy tracking system my bags made it to my destination and not laguardia like the app said
really not one of them can book dividend miles travel literally on hold now since  pm it is  pm noexcuses
yeah i know that but that does not get me my money back does it everytime i fly with you something bad happens
by the grace of god i made it  usairways rwg we do not have those powers in here we hope you can make that flight 
everyone is sorry do not have what i need for meeting tomorrow  charac is not nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
is the worst i have to pay  just to not take my first flight in a round trip otherwise they will cancelled flight my whole flight
if it was so important why did i wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer disappointed
thank u i wiil write after call travel agency

please hold flight us  in phoenix i am a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues

good work by flight  crew chairman s recognition even in coach too many missedupgrades late flightly what is up with this
changed our flight  times in  trip bumped to now amp having great experience never flying us air again never
i cannot wait to never fly with you again always delayed always lose my bag rudest people on the planet southwest is the best
i sent email to customer relations aa com will this work
sat on the ramp for  min and missed my connection no one seems to concerned at usairways
it is very difficult to work with baggage claims when they do not answer the phone
i lost an id on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in cleveland hopkins airport please help
i have better intel than she does she said plane is due in at  flightaware and your own app say 
not likely flightaware says plane is still in durango and has not departed
too little too late flight you suck rt oh no mitchell our agents are happy to offer you available options
hi i have a travel question could you please follow me so i can dm you
should but didnt
just now but no general announcement
what is going on with us airways flight  why diverted to charlotte
id suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely amp relevant schedule to prevent this in the future
i have been patient especially the first time i will never fly with you again
seriously every flight i have had the past  days has been delayed every single one terrible
i just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
what is up with flight  no gate agent or plane at phx b nice customer service
very embarrassing
im still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a flight attendant who isnt up on current policy to argue with a traveler
yes i know the industry procedure on baggage thanks for helping  what about the impossible connection that started this
i agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding amp we all sat in the plane for almost  hrs
and despite tailwind will still be late flight
 characters are not enough to convey the issue was directed to emailmailto customer relations usairways com unmonitored bad
thanks sent you dm re baggage issues
i have and you have not been able to locate them its insane i trust you and pay you to look after my things and you lost them
and yet the flight attendant argued with me over exec plat benefits
please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check itfits
has me on my toes whether i am going to make my flight back to boston tonight
need to check candy w working flight  iah to phx on usairways she is the reason i always choose rude
explain how come i can get a free upgrade on us as an exe plat but not exit row seating w out paying confused
yes ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very late flight
 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on  to sea leaving the same time this arrives is there a chance to hold
i have submitted my request i would appreciate a call by am eastern thank you
i need to email customer service for help and a question can you please provide the email address
there are significant number of folks on  connecting to  a few minutes hold would make many happy
can you help me out
is anything being done to make flight attendants aware of aa member benefits embarrassing being argued with just happened
i have a question i need to talk to someone by email can you give me your email address thanks
well there is certainly nothing happening in front of the scenes noaccountability disappointing
 hours on tarmac in charleston and still cannot get a response after a week unacceptable
customer service at its best rachel s took great care of us at the phx airport
amp planes in grandcayman
i will never fly us airways again
strikes again late flight crew   for the trip and maintenance   worth the extra  trip for less hassle and fewer delays
can you follow so i can dm you
so i get bumped to the pm to birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled do not have enough hours together fail
yes thanks but took forever
as far as being delayed goes looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it good news
horrible travel day w your airlines my   flight to birmingham was cancelled flightled w no notification so i could not get on the  
i asked if that was sop and they said it is now  but yet the other  flights nothing is this a policy or not
while im asking  of my  non upgraded flights attendants came amp greeted me amp thanked me for my business b c i was exec plat
 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the us  hr layover and i get to watch it going to wrong destination
it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink snack detailed here amp being argued with
i am so disappointed with the service i received with you on my travels to nc these past few days you lost my baggage twice
but question if the downgrade include losing first class do you get money back
have you just given up
and then you said i could move my thursday flight for free if i call a number and then you hang up on me
are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight not because of weather i am in arizona
your moveup policy really sucks united has a  hour policy for this with status i was wanting to move up from am to am
great management of twitter account thank you
why is it impossible to change buy preferred seats via your app
i am good i just did not understand the terminology but the merger brings new verbiage

flt   hrs late flight baggage  more hr now i see they delivered my suitcase wet inside amp out nothappy
then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight
so she has to take a late flightr flight booked by her corporate disney travel dept as your agent offered little help
your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
as the employee responsible for social media content yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise
flight gets in  minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags are not here  minutes late flightr

sorry does not help it is midnight pst how in the hell am i still on hold after  minutes on customer service line
like i thought this was america when did us airways start operating under the rules of communist russia
you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest at least they treat their customers properly
but nope apparently this is the way you guys do business i guess i am flying southwest and her blue from now on
i keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to reno tonight
there is over  people in line and only one agent
and by the way i am planning it while i ve ben waiting in the line at customer service in phx for over an hour
already planning my local boycott for washington d c area
i can legitimately say that i would have rather driven cross country than flown on us airways
and despite the fact i see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me
you guys are the worst airline i ve ever dealt with no notifications no keeping customers updated terrible service
hey guys thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at  pm pst
any progress good luck patrick
he is fine he really likes picking his own seat
is the worst airline to ever travel with
has to be the most lazy inconsiderate and unprofessional airline that i have ever traveled

your customer service is horrendous between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights
had mom sit for  hours waiting for a flight they ultimately cancelled flighted to give her a tuesday morning flight no compensation ugh
does anyone from your airline know how to do their job
has to be the worst airline of all time
denied me standby bc of checked bag in cvg  to phl  so i had to take delayed   hrs late flightr except u lost bag in cvg
you reminded me today why i fly

not given option for new flight why cannot we get a plane phl mia years as an eventprof this is worst travel experience ever
does not let u do stand by on flight due to checked bag causing u to get in  hours late flightr only to get to phl amp bag did not make it
and are not as merged as the marketing departments would have us believe maybe or can get me home
absolutely worst experience of my life at phl  hrs  failed departure  gates and zero communication or help
as soon as i call customer service to speak to a representative i am disconnected
have been trying to call customer service since pm after an hour was disconnected spoke to no one
give us no information and an attitude
looking for some help to recover an item i left on an airplane this evening
attendants at the gate enjoyed watching the other flight to our destination take off before having a horrible attendant give us
now has stranded is in miami without updating any of the departure boards and once they cancelled flightled the flight there was no

still on hold  hour and  minutes and counting platinum who cares problems checking in who cares
how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 
i respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule replane  ppl who are already late flight youcandobetter
now i am on flight to fll and told to take a train back to pbi to get my car there are no trains to pbi
i fly quite a bit and it is not difficult to communicate if agents let people know what is happening arrangements can be made
handled on the phone unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip which is why i am so displeased
headed to nyc from clt funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan has happened twice more
made it send bloody mary s to row 
 out of gainesville fl
i already let them know and sent  complaints got a call back finally when i was asleep and there is no return call back
thank you for valuing my feedback what will you do with it
the flights were not from this morning it was  flights  on thursday and  on monday which turned into tuesday
i spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold sad badservice mergerdisaster
your customer service is a nightmare i have been on hold for  hour i am a platinum member with aa and feel like it is worthless
never let us me down every single flight gets delayed
sitting on the ground in charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy friday hope i make my connection

big thanks to yvonne anthony from the chairman s desk top tier customer service today outstanding service amp support
now the plane is  degrees and we are burning up this is completely illegal
are you fucking kidding me
now siting on tarmac in philly for another  minutes this is so lame sorry does not help this is terrible
what is the damn delay
it would be nice to just pull up to the gate still sitting here
app is the worst one for airlines cannot do anything once your original flight time has gone by useless
has completely wasted my work day thank you for the bad service and bad friday
and also it is great that you tweet complainers but what about the in person help when i need it robyn f in manch useless
you will be receiving a long amp detailed complaint letter soon long story short never flying usair again
thanks for making miss connection getting rebooked missing that too and a miserable day started my day  am for nothing
need to learn operations sit a plane overnight at gsp and not realize there is a mech problem then delay flight    hours
that the flight was delayed amp closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half bad bad service
why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
he overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled you should refund me i had no choice grossedout
i appreciate your prompt response
nothing was available male flight crew was not nice dismissive big guy was standby and probably did not even pay for choice
well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on
i did not want to hang out on your plane all day when i am traveling to get work done and turn right back around unacceptable
does not seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in lax and you recycle bagtag numbers that does not help usairwaysfail
this is a complete waste of my day a trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day ridiculous
we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight
the plane is moving and it is no ice we are moving to the end of the runway to sit because lga has one runway open
of course weather was a joke  beats  degrees in phl 
nothing was available male flight crew was not nice dismissive big guy was standby and probably did not even pay
is setting themselves up for a lawsuit no way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half
thks us    phl to fll overall st class has improved with more food now on phl to fll and most crews are super
i want to not sit on a plane from dca to lga for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight
this is so unacceptable i am going for the day now most of my day will be sitting on your plane not to mention there is no air
is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half they did not even let us off
hi is there somebody avail who can help with an refund its unbelievable on the phone w us for more than  hrs in  days
plus a us airways you need to do something about this i left philly to thaw out
ordered a scotch amp water and f a asked if i wanted full glass or half  yrs old and first time ever asked that
yeah the mark was like a mile back also we are an hour late flight so thanks a ton for the great service today
we got  drink then f a sat in jump seat doing crosswords glasses picked up at landing just a very lazy service  first class
paid for a choice seat my choice is to not have big man next to me in my seat too oldseatnocushion worstflight nohelponboard
first class no snack basket was catered so drinks only no preflight drink or coathanging st drink service  min after take off
you told us last night that there was a ground stop at o hare four hours after obama landed stop blaming someone else
 delayed due to frozentoilet medicalissue mechanicalissue dispatchissue we have heard it all letsgo
able does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w luggage that will not fit overhead
 trying to make a connection to punta cana leave phl at  
is the worst  minute delay in boston not weather relate flightd going to miss our connecting flight gassing up the plane issue

on flight  waiting for weight and balance info for the past  minutes
thank you for refunding me on my baggage really appreciate it
thanks for taking my flight off the board and not providing and updates about my flight which is  minutes late flight
i am so going to miss us airways you always provided great service and never let me down
never again worse experience in my life
i rebooked myself but cancelled flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable you started delaying at  pm
 hrs stranded in dca zero apologies and the worst customer service been a faithful traveler for  years but no more
this response does not correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
been at dca at  pm still here at  am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane absolutely worse experience
it was  almost  hours late flight due to mechanical
never flying usairways again horrible experience terrible customer service
mobile boarding pass email
we will sunday just a few days away
i am following you now
unacceptable you knew the pilot would not be able to complete the trip wasted all of our time
i have been on three planes for flight  and still have not left the ground bad service sad
then told to offload because the captain was over hours this has been a terrible experience
why were we loaded onto the plane  hours late flight mind you made to sit for  minutes
why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period unacceptable
offloading the plane this is ridiculous
 usairways we are excited to have you fly with us jb when will this be  spring break
still just sitting here nobody has said anything what is up
that is actually not true you can get a seat online after a big hassle that policy is totally dishonest and misleading faa
i will thank you for at least tweeting me back better than most 
that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
that is incorrect four people last flight of the night with our bags horriblecustomerservice
exicted to be flying with you all soon
and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking  buttons
the fact that you are making customers pay  to choose a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors
ill do that in addition to reviewing on my blog your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than
your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide shameonyou usairwayssucks
worst experience ever with you guyssee my blog tomorrow on my experience maybe you can help make it better
now the freezing bus is just doing circles
please explain i have plenty of time since i am stranded
i doubt that its  p amp we r still being held captive on the ground at dca a little communication from up front would b nice
why does it cost  to change a  ticket when it only cost  to purchase a new ticket
 sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane what is up
we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary
does not want me to get home
they do not stand alone for me i bought tix based on usair confirmed flight what good is confirmation if you change it anyway
dca gt hpn u r prof hostage takers we stood on bus  plane for  min now sitting on plane with no mvmt amp  announcement  gt hour
i bet you do not but i am the paying customer here i know how to check for flight delays thank you
i cannot even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive forcing me to purchase a new ticket
oh great after a  hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving flight  has been awful
that is the st sorry i received from your company the least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge
never flying with you guys again extremely disorganized and too many delays
my buddies are currently delayed   hours and counting in dca on their ways to cae for a golf week any compensation flydelta
flights  was the delay flight  was my missed connection help
the flight that i did not connect to was 
even when i do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so will not be that difficult am sure disappointed
yes not sure how you guys do not know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
wow your miles program is ripoff quick ticket fee  i hope you all end up on unemployment
bos gt dca delayed again this needs to stop i will be filing complaints with the faa and consumer affairs
sitting on the tarmac waiting to deplane  minutes the level of service i ve come to expect
you gladly take the loyal customer s money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused
the least you could do is make up for what you have caused you are ruining people s memories you should be ashamed
st a late flight plane then missing flight crew then maintenance problems gates switched  times you call this customer service
due to your expensive change fees either out of all the airlines we chose yours all do you could screw us stranded no help
we cannot afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home turns out we cannot afford to go home
but it is not their fault because their policy says they at least got us to our destination really
ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight and now we are stranded

over min hold on your reservation line embarrassing aa platinum member
love the changes in the lounge cheese veggies olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix
thanks if you have another method also that would be nice appears to be a design flaw
yes every one of these on every flight is like this there needs to be more velcro or something
please secure the footrest shelf in business class on a airplanes
forgetting to fuel up realizing there was more cargo to add to plane one way to try and mask a delay
your gate team are polite but your planes are habitually late flight in many cases passengers are waiting for the flight crew

flying from manchester international to philadelphia and getting emails about delays no information about connecting flights
thank you  to cincy just landed you should add frequent flyer miles to my account a long incredibly frustrating day
no other than being on my credit card statement i have not received anything from you and so i have no way to look it up myself
i waited on hold for too long i should not have to wait on hold forever when i never received a confirm in the st place help
been dealing w to solve the probs your team created your manch nh staff is clearly your c team btw notevenjv
will do
unfortunately i doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the merger usairways
thank you we filled out a claim and hope to have the bags tomorrow
i did not cancelled flight my flight you did than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags
done
i was told my ticket expired but i never recvd any notice before it expired this sucks i paid k miles amp  for the tckt
captain on flight  from phx phl at   tonight was hilarious greetings from the pointy end of the airplane haha thanks
just noticed that i do not believe i saw a confirmation for a flight i bought a few weeks ago def paid though help resend
worst customer service still not providing me an answer even after i drove back to clt airport been rude amp unacceptable fail
any plans to support applepay on board i have the usairways mc and it would be nice to still use it if i forget the card
got through on the phone usair cancelled flightled her return flights because she missed a flight on her way out they took care of it
i have run out of patience we are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyonemin
 delays  cancelled flightlations a double layover and  hours late flightr could i at least get extra dividend miles
 usairways we appreciate the shoutout for roberto dm your confirmation code so we can forward your kind words  sent
i did not take my original flight i was suppose to arrive last night than by  pm today did not get in til 
sitting for  minutes on the runway at dca because your gates are full early landing late flight flight
flight let us off this plane please go to a gate this is absurd
will i get the full amount credited to my account for us airways credit
 trips in a row with missing luggage just like last time i pay for baggage to be transported
lost our luggage yay
i found a flight i want on is my aa advantage applicable to earn miles on it since you are merging
really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at phl for a ground crew to taxi us in at pm at night why is this taking so long
thanks for calling me about my  p redirected flight at  p smoothoperation
its just a very bad customer service experience can you help
i have been trying to reach dividend miles to extend my ticket for last  days  calls and i get a message to call back
really
how does an airline misplace an airline attendant been at reagan airport since pm  to cincy is delayed trying to find her
my flight finally arrived in charlotte they booked my luggage thru to lga but no room on flight for me what a mess
been on hold for over an hour still do not know where my bags are will not refund me my flight it was not weather
no your not
my wife had flight changes due to weather now she cant checkin to her return flight and it fails is it possible usair cancelled flightled
thank you for fixing my  hour delay
yup   minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing
this is more than having patience this is not acceptable
please follow me so i can dm you about something
 flights in hrs amp i ve had the same flight attendant for  of those flights freaky coincidence plus side she is great
landed safely everything worked out
can you explain why i am on hold over an hour other than i am dumb and should be using a different airline wth
you used to have an evening flight dca dsm and an early am return now it is middle of the work day for both inconvenient
delays to the max
on sunday cannot wait see you then
well this is nofun nocustomerservice onhold trying to make reservations nothappy
it should not take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes  minutes flying time  minutes on runway so far
attempting ckin for flight on   all day site unable to retrieve details called twice and disconnected
emailed them a week ago and still nothing
i would be willing to pay anything to change a flight does not help
yeah you guys just told me to call the website that i booked from i booked on your website unacceptable
still waiting captain reports he is called  times to get ground crew and still sitting on runway evenlate flightr
is the real mvp for holding up the flight connecting philly to tampa
finally rectified my flight situation thanks again
so what is the difference between cancelled flighting and reflight booking problems will that help me avoid a change fee
on time today and from phl nice work thereisafirstforeverything
you have most likely lost my business terrible experience too many times stuck on tarmac and last min cancelled flightled flights done
i have been doing that all day cannot find my bag anywhere bc they are saying it was never scanned amp technically never left lax
why no ground crew at dca when we are already late flight arriving evenlate flightr
being told tough break and this is how it is is unacceptable you cannot even tell me when my bags will be here
ice cream up front solid
shout out to the pilots and fc attendant eliz of us  super strong crosswinds during landing eliz did a super job throughout
now telling me i do not have the correct tag for my luggage my luggage apparently is not in la or charlotte this is not ok
your software is broken call customer support is not the fix like i said earlier yell at your developers
it is not double booked i spoke with cs and we have got a plan to fix this it is still an amateur mistake that should never happen
is there nothing that can be done online to help i bought these as a birthday present just trying to be able to afford a change
hey guys due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way i can get a checked bag credit
delayed  days for weather and on top i got yelled at for being late flight when i was not notified of the time change welldone
not a great experience for my first time flying us airways going forward i ll probably be taking my business elsewhere
loosing a lot of business by using barclays i cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in iowa
i was re accommodated for my dsm flight tonight after a delay from myrtle beach now the flight to dsm is back on for tonight
so far i ve gotten six different answers
oh certainly and now i have two  pending transactions on my bank account really happy that i was charged double
i got an email asking me to checkin tmrw for a flight i meant to book for   can someone please help
what is going on i ve been hearing a not friendly please wait on repeat while i am on hold being transferred to idk where
the captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around that is not good
i am sorry as well it is been  hrs without my bag and i cannot get a straight answers i am on call  for today
ya ll need to work on your online checkout system two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league yell at your devs
i wish we were on our way now there is a problem w de icing three amp   hour delay so far amp sill not sure if we will be taking off
if you could have ran your usexpress psa worth a damn i would not be stuck in horrible clt now
you run a piece of shit airline thanks for ruining aa
 usairways we appreciate the shoutout for roberto dm confirmation code so we can forward ur kind words  confirmation code
finally back on board door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel you think someone wd have thought of it earlier
secondary screenings a piece of the plane missing anything you want to tell us
sitting on tarmac in pit for  min no announcement just sitting
my tsa precheck is not showing up on my boarding pass for my flight tomorrow help usairways tsaprecheck
i appreciate that you actually monitor twitter so please pass along my feedback i ve tried calling about  times in  days
cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member
i do not think i ve ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly
please improve your phone system going through multiple prompts amp menus just to be told to call back late flightr major fail
once again your service leaves a lot to be desired flight  here early but short staffing means we wait on tarmac thanks
the late flightr flight to charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier that is so wrong
i am delayed in cha will miss my connection in charlotte for lga not good
we did it added about seven hours to our day so far want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in kc notcool
she missed her uncle s funeral and you hope they can find another flight that is very considerate of you
my last flight was cancelled flightled and i am very disappointed
just lost a faithful customer
i have  times and no one has been able to help me out
marsha m at myrtle beach is the greatest she deserves all the respect and praise there is thankyouforeverything
seriously attendants go awol for  mins now flight further delayed do not lite a match either
joined silver preferred because i heard customer service was so great pity i was misguided
it is just bad practice and i am disappointed that your airline was not prepared honestly the last time i fly with you guys
well this is about as worthless as your regular service a bunch of do nothings and idiots sucks
these changes as well to late flightr find out that the flight i was scheduled for is not ready
after  cancelled flightlations and a delay causing me to miss connecting flight another night not being home thanks pathetic
that is understandable my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it i changed my plans to accommodate
thanks now i just need to locate where my luggage is
we have not departed yet so let us not get too high hopes but everything has been on schedule so far
thanks for showing interest  to greenville sc
your app sucks balls compared to
usairways so my flight was late flight getting into charlotte so i miss my connector to phoenix thanks again last time i ever fly usair
thanks suggestion stop the promo messages after a bit and just run music amp a msg that says call volume is high vrm
admirals club at clt has rude and ignorant front desk staff you have fallen so far thanks doug parker
to clt from jfk nasty planes dirty seats amp floors rude flight attendants hopefully aa can get you cleaned up disgusting vile
i paid for my ticket on on the th and it still says pending is that normal i just want the money out of my account
ok thank you we were told ground delay due to snow
this made me have to cancelled flight my car reservation and it came out to more money why did you reschedule a time without the crew
my flight was cancelled flightled yesterday and moved to today then while at my stop in dc my flight is delayed due to lack of crew us
looking forward to some friends and family time in arizona
no they dont i think i already said that no one responds its an auto response wait is this an auto response
first class all the way  headed to
started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck
us my wife in boston says no snow right now
i tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over  mins please hold we do not care
you see now that is a lie they auto respond with insulting email sucks
your pple did a great job w the madness however some of your systems need help i appreciate the hard work amp the push to b better
thanks for giving away my seat another fine job
how can i be stuck on a plane due to snow in boston when it is not actually snowing in boston usair flight  us
i ve been waiting for desk for  and on hold min and counting photo of desk agent on phone not flattering
thanks
you have cancelled flighted our flights  times over the past  days and the experience has been the worst never again
thanks to betty working gate at ilm and lovely gate agents here in clt helping me get home  phx tonight instead of tomorrow
i have a flight in saturday from mci to clt and there is heavy snow predicted in mci when will u allow for changes
i realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting cancelled flighted please prioritize ur passengers and help them
how does that help me when i get no response from there usairwayssucks
team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged not happy blizzard
surprisingly quick response time by you and them thanks
stop cancelled flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers strandedinnashville
strikes again lost bags and two of them theworst
had  cancelled flight my trip to la bc weather was easy but us air is making me pay  to use the credit never again
what is the point of a baggage claim ticket if they do not scan it for tracking
no access to dividend miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back late flightr frustrated livepersonplease
you cannot even track my bag to see where it is it is like it is disappeared
cannot get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles it is been over a month since travel amp i ve submitted twice online
i been sitting on this plane for  minutes and they are saying another  minutes something about paper work this sucks
is there gonna be a better day to call i ve called on  separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person
i spent more on the room amp transportation then i did the whole flight
i ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that i had to spend
i asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
only to come home a day late flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
doubt it gate x is a cluster and every agent encounter i saw including one with me was outright rude just very put off
i have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport
the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do
so mad i cannot even believe you guys cancelled flight my connecting flight after i leave the first stop amp give me a useless hotel voucher
priorities should have been made considering a pending snow storm why delay a flight for an hour amp a half i d like an answer
i experienced what defines customer service on flt a flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
i ve done everything still no luck in finding my bag i do not understand how my bag could have been misplaced very upsetting
that wasnt my q but thanks wondering why youre the only ones i disguised yours to not call you out
turns into with such difficulty to past loyal customer as a aa platinum flyer usair could not be more unhelpful why
yes but i will nvr fly w i missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on ft could not see my father be they put him in a coma
 minutes to put my tsa number in  mins and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct
so i would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone usairwayssucks
really so what does that mean usairwayssucks
thanks can you help remind the agents it is ok ps heard rumors of a streaming wifi tv movie service you might be installing
nope done was supposed to get home at pm and did not get home until midnight neveragain
the only way to assist is to actually answer the phone
would it kill you to give me   seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold
would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation
would it kill you to not let   miles expire
would it kill you to let me know how many minutes i might be on hold
a  totaled not happy not at all
i have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply s usairwaysssuck
the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for  hours is i do not really know what happened
thanks
my number is    cant wait lol usairsucks
have him call me i cant wait to see if anything happens your service really sucks usairwayssucks
she also appreciated having her very own hashtag lucycat
we hate delays have you tried any of these although we are not sure what a timbit is
big fail on not having curbside baggage in pittsburgh and you charge  dollars a bag
is it possible to earn dividend miles for a passenger that is not me even if i am purchasing the tickets
i hope so too thank you for your help she traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase
would you consider honoring the original fare price if i were to try flight booking problems the ticket again
booked an award ticket recently now same ticket is less miles how do i contact you without using the online form or phone
you are the best follow me please 
would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible
that is ok just know that i ll most likely never book with you again
i followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around your service sucks usairwayssuck
i do not mind waiting i mind waiting on a plane when i should not have had to the airport has more room and you know food
that is appreciated however the system tells you call back late flightr then ends the call no need to reply thanks
why would you board ppl on a plane b its their turn to de ice why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process
i tried that before using twitter also gave me no helpful information thank you anyway
i am sure you are sincere in your apology its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers options
yeah i know that but now i ll have to spend almost  dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week
yeah either by refunding my money or  free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through
are you an incompetent airline every day or just days that end in y
there is not a ticket number the transaction is still pending
do families no longer get early boarding with young kids american your new parent gives it to us
not patient originally   and now  
your agent did not say
no they could be at laguardia jfk or charlotte i have no idea where they are now tho
they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not what airline serves food anymore update in policy
it is the nd person when i called again to ask could not catch her name rejected the request
must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook fendforyourself
that link is broken but if it is the online baggage locator i already tried it and it gave me no useful information
spoke on the phone  or  times but no resolution i am still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up
thanks for reaching out to me my gold div no kj my flights were changed under confirmation dnxv

i absolutely knew you would try to blame weather to deny us vouchers in phoenix totally false was a crew issue
half an inch of snow in charlotte overwhelming
on the phone now looks like global
already filed a report personally at the airport however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number
already called no other options flight is being reimbursed never again you are unreliable for business travelers
your saving grace was our flight attendant dallas who was amazing wish he would transfer to delta where i would see him again
that link leads to a website that will not open on a cell phone good job shocking that your airline is folding
my flight us got cancelled flightled on   due to lack of flight crew i was told that i d be reimbursed for hotel who do i contact
no need for apologies just an unfortunate situation there is no up date i ve landed but was suppose to land at 
 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab promises does not make up for it
my sister was supposed to leave at  am to go back to al she is only getting to nc now are you kidding me neverflyusairways

commitment to excellence is b praised can get you to the wrong city  days late flight or the right one  days late flight customerservice
car services to and from the hotel food hotel cost bc of cancelled flightlations fall on the customer with last minute notifications
i am amazed at the lack of communication with the passengers
when i told csr i would close acct he could not care less
beware barklays bank has terrible cust service will not assist only know to go by badly written book in english
they call weather an act of god and refuse to help i have my wife and  kids and they have no sympathy

i want to speak to a human being this is not an obscene request
no response to dm or email yet customer service
should reconsider usairways acquisition flight  aa gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket

i d like to apologize to the gate agent for flight aa i was not aware that zone  was after the nine other precious gems

origin destination dates are the same going from us airways connecting flight to aa direct flight award is saver level
when will the old   fly ord pvg get upgraded
i know just a little cold weather humor

disappointing lack of kindness toward this person the agent asked her counterparts why this person was talking to her

lax ogg lax using hard earned miles and was given lousy service faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag your customer care
they were no where to be found at midnight last night i would think the agent in lax could have relayed that info bag on flt
you cancelled flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat not acceptable upgrade to emergency row would help nothappy
is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a  bag and not replace and shrug the damage off flights from
it is not good enough you need to provide a phone number other partners do should be investigated by
lol great answer  americanair our agents are checking in passengers as quickly as possible we appreciate your patience 
super spring tides and tide of the century drawing tourists to french and u k coasts
ps i was right
yes it is in dulles and i need it delivered to the embassy suites in herndon va i am still in chicago from the fiasco in lax
what is the point so i can wait for another  weeks u r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone
machines are broken lines are out the door for self service cust support and bag check in
would have been had i seen this before pm est when i was sound asleep
merged airlines do not work for ff programs very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care attitudeissues
you do not have those abilities anywhere not at the ticket counter at cust service or online that is why we are done here
when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think aa would want to earn your business but guess not
needs to get their shit together  counter people amp a massive line people need to catch their flights
i know your policy just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances
the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing just wow
oh no she left the counter and went downstairs then she told elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter
of course you are because that is your companies job you guys failed at it in the first place upgrade me and then we will talk
maybe long trip late flight night amp queues at baggage claims in two terminals no good i thought i paid for it  instead
you really need some customer service training for your unhappy ees in the morning in chicago gate k at  chking her schd
  i sat on the runway for  more hrs b takeoff  hrs late flight   am pilot plainly stated it was a comp mech issue
flight  n prepares for flight at before departing for
alright prove it    days ago i sat on a plane at jfk for  hrs deplaned for  more and when i re boarded
i am trying to choose my seats but every time i go to the next flight i get system error
thanks both airlines said that it is located at aa detroit also was informed that it flew with aa which should not matter
we did talk with delta for about hour over phone and i got a number from delta that they asked to give to aa which i did
policy makers need to change their mindset on aviation flying is not for
already did reply was sorry we believe this to be fair as a journalist writing an article on my trip i will include this
leave us stranded send baggage with important medication to different city for days amp apologise with a  voucher appalling
i ve been trying to change a thursday flight and there is a ridiculous wait time on the phone and your website is not helping
uk i saw an american  in old colours at on saturday was surprised to see

plane veers off runway at icy dallas airport
thank you for the acknowledgement the ife did not work all that well anyway so maybe time to upgrade to lower profile system
thanks for the canned reply
just went to check into flight  hr advance again husband and i are seated separately for hr flight why does this happen
no i just expect a higher level of customer service amp for the flight crews to give us accurate information
or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was cancelled flightled
i tried when i landed but there was no one there i ve emailed your customer service twice now who do not seem to care
no i ve since rebooked with another airline what i would like is compensation for all the time money lost

another generic response guys cmon you are terrible how about an actual helpful person not all the rude employees at lax
i tried extremely rude even the supervisor and when i asked to speak to his supervisor i was told no
yes but you are still human i hope dealing with all the horror stories people share i complained to dot everyone should
try contacting everyone on that flight with a refund offer and we might believe you are sincere
i have filed multiple complaints i prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp
worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation
terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over  days total angrycustomer
worst service ever delayed flights for more than  hours plus you missed my bag and your employees are rude 
thanks for the generic computer generated response how about you accommodate your travelers instead of just saying sorry
they are giving cots to the people that did not get hotel rooms that is terrible
i did twice got a letter back saying that your company does not issue refunds for phone bills help phone will be shut off
oh yeah i guess those are two different things  am does weird things to my brain thanks again xox
yes no one is answering and i am on a train
ty but their site says please note that we do not offer a print subscription service for american way

sitting on plane for  hrs at gate due to computer sys issue at what point do you cancelled flight a flight ridiculous
not a valid response in  for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions stop understaffing
yo could that be a catering truck before mine eyes unmoving
this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter but they cannot staff a call center
great seats on this aircraft
is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at been waiting hrs and still have not even seen one plane
both pictures taken at the same time but which is right totallyconfused

tomorrows flight cancelled flighted i understand three hour wait for a call back and now  minutes on hold not cool
all flights cancelled flighted tomorrow and that means i am stranded at the airport for the night wow

this is unbelievable and unacceptable flight  jfk everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day
i made my flight but then still had no update emails when i landed no info ever sent on that or second flight losing my biz
flight  dfw still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded still waiting
i still am not on a flight ive been here allll day and now we are not boarding because we are waiting for catering
my husband and  year old son stuck overnight in dc thanks to  crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again
versus in customer service who will win for me is a convenience to a trip to cali lt 
agents refuse to help too busy amp need to call advantage no one willing to help and apparently being exec plat means zero

of course it was not your intention issue lies in lack of response she did contact you directly she sat on hold for  mins
