2	-1	ok thanks safety first
1	-1	apparently the plane was delayed coming up from san juan monsoon there today

2	-1	thank you hopefully it is soon we are supposed to leave at  
2	-1	thank you
3	-1	awesome
1	-1	okay so anything using contactless emv should work just your internal testing and training is currently apple pay specific
1	-1	hard when you are with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane we should get better than this
3	-2	had a potentially stressful situation in reflight booking problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome
1	-1	even tho the extra  lbs are still going on the plane just as a carry on where is the sense what do you say to fat people
2	-1	i thought being a mosaic member had perks the best part is instead of checking the extra lbs i am carrying it on 
1	-3	are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days you went from  to  for overweight fees outrageous
2	-1	if only the show was on the flight no abc oh well i ll live nexttime andthewinneris
1	-3	ill call in the morning too upset right now
1	-1	im still waiting no answer
2	-1	ok thanks for your help
3	-1	love you guys
1	-1	the amount of money i spent on hotels for a week bc of flight cancelled flightlation another flight does not make up for the money lost
1	-1	being told jfk had a  hour delay this am which is reason for my delay now it cannot be that hard to notify with  hours notice
1	-3	by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk
1	-1	keep waiting time does not cost anything for hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback
2	-1	you are still the best
2	-4	please give jetblue all the permissions in the world i am missing the oscars right now and it is awful whyabcwhy
2	-2	thanks so the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather relate flightd problems
1	-3	i ll be checking often most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds geeks and badly dressed
1	-1	i am less concerned about the delay than i am about not being notified until i looked at the board that my flight was delayed
2	-1	thanks i made it 
1	-1	after boarding flight  the captain informs that he could exceed the hrs regulation and turned the plane around incredible
2	-1	thanks for the quick response fingers crossed the plane gets here then
1	-1	considering accessibility is an absolute must equality
1	-1	how do we watch the oscars though right now no abc on flight missingtheoscars
2	-1	thank you fingers crossed
2	-1	ooookay that is silly of you guess we are watching the oscars purely on twitter reactions tonight oscars
1	-1	i ve heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept only apple pay i thought that was impossible amp certainly not emv compliant
1	-1	you are taking me to new orleans in two weeks so i ll picture that while i shiver forevercold
1	-1	we are flight  ffl to lga scheduled departure  p
1	-1	nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster last time i was not allowed to fly stndby now a  hour delay w out notification
1	-1	oh right me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in sdq
1	-1	a bunch of flights are delayed from ffl to northeast destinations no announcements at the gate what is going on
1	-1	i am dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight  in santo domingo have been treated hrs to board the plane and no info given
2	-1	id appreciate that would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that i be allowed to announce over intercom
2	-1	if you want we can keep you updated on who is wearing who amp who is with who amp who wins what we are nice like that
1	-1	i did they have no idea where it is
2	-3	thanks but still annoying especially if i miss my flight  can i tweet at the tsa
2	-1	hey jetblue still waiting to hear where you lost my   surfboard between jfk and bqn airports
1	-1	your gif game is strong
2	-1	well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility
1	-1	flight  den to jfk already hrs delayed any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc
1	-3	why close prechk at pm on a sunday at jfk annoying
2	-1	your crew did not say it was about safety if they say that i was glad to stay check the information you give to the costumers
1	-2	you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in south florida bc of your disorganization getittogether
1	-1	i am going to write a post on about the experience your customer service has tanked jetblue
1	-1	still no response from ceo i guess he is at the oscars i bet his flight was on time justwrong
1	-1	okay names of sj crew are alamo tatiana keep telling me to hold then leave desk ali told me he could not help bc going on break
2	-4	aha ok thanks was worried there might not be a seat at all will do it at the airport tomorrow then
1	-3	that is a stock response delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv amp being told by  ppl to wait amp they would come back but did not
1	-1	ricoh smith at bos provided oust and service
1	-3	 hr delay on flight to jfk via tampa amp worst customer service in san juan airport this after app not working all day
1	-1	just please get my luggage from  onto carousel  logan airport and i ll be able to go home
1	-1	what happens when i have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for even more space upgrades
2	-4	thanks for the response just been waiting for  hours and really frustrated seems like no one at jetblue is concerned
3	-1	tx for the info just do not understand why you could not accurately estimate departure time earlier weather in ny is fine now
2	-1	hey me and my family have questions on a trip to disney world that we are doing in april please follow me so i could dm you guys
4	-1	 jetblue so glad to hear thanks for sharing the video  me and jetblue are bff

1	-1	from san diego with a  hour delay to jfk even you have a amex jetblue even having over   travel miles you are still nothing

1	-1	exicted to be flying with you all soon
1	-1	and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking  buttons
1	-2	the fact that you are making customers pay  to choose a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors

1	-2	st a late flight plane then missing flight crew then maintenance problems gates switched  times you call this customer service
1	-2	due to your expensive change fees either out of all the airlines we chose yours all do you could screw us stranded no help
1	-1	we cannot afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home turns out we cannot afford to go home

1	-1	they were no where to be found at midnight last night i would think the agent in lax could have relayed that info bag on flt
1	-1	you cancelled flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat not acceptable upgrade to emergency row would help nothappy
1	-2	is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a  bag and not replace and shrug the damage off flights from

2	-1	the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing just wow
1	-1	oh no she left the counter and went downstairs then she told elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter
