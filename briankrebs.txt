@MalwareJake @MalwareTechBlog @dakami sorry. i don't buy the 'it's too hard' argument.
@MalwareJake @MalwareTechBlog @dakami that's bs. the bigger ISPs absolutely can tell. They just don't see it as their job.
Reputation based routing is like this: Want to continue to let assholes run the Internet? no problem. just wait more than everyone else.
@jonrog1 it's not about laws. it's about how everything meaningful on the Web gets done. By routing around censorship. That's what this is.
"Naming and shaming works. Always has, always will. The data has to be there. Will any providers stand by it is the question."
@dakami @sweharris which oversimplification?
"@MalwareTechBlog @dakami my point exactly. so if those that don't are in the minority, it should not be hard to hold them up to the light."
Couching this as a BGP problem is a cop-out. Everyone knows that BGP is fundamentally broken. Reputation-based routing is different.
